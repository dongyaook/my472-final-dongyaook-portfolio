# Olympic Gender Participation and Medal Performance Analysis (1896â€“2020)

This project presents an integrated analysis of gender participation trends and medal performance in the Summer Olympic Games from 1896 to 2020. It combines multi-source data to explore gender disparities, their historical evolution, and links to broader social development indicators.

## Project Overview

- Tracks the evolution of male and female athlete participation in the Summer Olympics.
- Analyses gender differences in medal performance across countries and time.
- Investigates correlations between gender equality in sports and global development indicators, such as the United Nations Gender Inequality Index (GII).
- Demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline from acquisition to reproducible reporting.

## Technical Highlights

- Static web scraping using **CSS selectors** and **XPath** within R.
- Dynamic web scraping with **Selenium** for interactive websites.
- Public **API integration** to enrich datasets.
- Relational database management and querying with **SQLite** and **SQL**.
- Data cleaning, integration, and analysis using **R**, **tidyverse**, and **dplyr**.
- Statistical modelling, regression analysis, and insight generation.
- Data visualisation of gender trends, participation rates, medal performance, and development indicators.
- Reproducible reporting with **RMarkdown** and interactive **HTML** outputs.
